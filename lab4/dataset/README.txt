Analysis of altered level of blood-based biomarkers in prognosis of COVID-19 patients


The dataset is of patients with and without COVID-19. Dataset comprises 3 sheets. First sheet details for demographic informations such as age, age group and gender of the patients, while second sheet for biochemical, hematological, inflammatory, coagulatory and cardiac tested. Third sheet included the significant laboratory findings specific to deceased and non-deceased COVID-19 patients. Exact or direct age is removed and categorized as age group in order to anonymize the data. 

Data were anonymized with the code. Patients with COVID-19 were coded with alphanumeric number with initial Pno. (P1, P23, etc.) and patients without COVID-19 with initical Cno. (C12, C45, etc.). 
Units of the laboratory parameters were standard and as follows: 
Biochemistry	Glucose (mg/dL)
		Urea (mg/dL)
		Creatinine (mg/dL)
		Sodium (mEq/L)
		Potassium (mmol/L)
		Total Bilirubin (mg/dL)
		Direct Bilirubin (mg/dL)
		Alanine transaminase (U/L)
		Aspartate aminotransaminase (U/L)
		Alkaline phosphatase (U/L)
		Total protein (g/dL)
		Albumin (g/dL)
		Lactate dehydrogenase (U/L)
Hematology	Hemoglobin (g/dL)
		White blood cells (billion cells/L)
		Platelet (billion/L)
Inflammatory	C-Reactive Protein (mg/L)
		Procalcitonin (ng/ml)
		Interleukin-6 (pg/ml)
		Ferritin (�g/L)
Coagulatory	Prothrombin Time (sec)
		D-dimer (ng/mL)
Cardiac		Creatinine phosphokinase-MB (U/L)

The D-dimer, CPK-MB, ferritin, CRP, PCT, and IL-6 were analyzed by Fluorescent Immunoassay (Fine Care-III plus, China). All biochemistry biomarkers were analyzed by Fully Automated Biochemistry Analyzer (Diatron Pictus 500, Hungary), except for sodium and potassium, which were measured by Medica EasyLyte Analyzer (United States). The hematological biomarkers were analyzed by Coulter Counter (DxH 500, Beckman Coulter, Germany). 
Except for gender and age group, the data were quantitative and were calculated as mean�standard deviation in SPSS version 17.0. Quantitative variables were analyzed using t-test for statistical correlations, and qualitative variables using chi-square test.
